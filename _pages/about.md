Hello, dear reader of my blog! My name is Mofrison, I started with the layout of **VKontakte** wiki pages and the creation of sites on **WordPress**, and now I am developing applications for **Android** and **Oculus VR**. Most of the time I use **Android Studio** and **Unity3d**. I like to create something new and different, using non-standard approaches and finding optimal solutions.

I try to contribute to open source projects and decided to create my own blog where I plan to share my work in the hope that it will be useful to someone else. On my site you can see the [projects]({{site.url}}/projects) that I am working on, as well as the [tasks]({{site.url}}/cases) that I have solved in these projects.

My non-technical interests are in hiking and outdoor activities (although you can't tell by looking at me).
